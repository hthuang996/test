# ERC20
This is an ERC20 contract in `ink`.

## Specification
This ERC20 contract is based on the example code in [ink](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/tree/master/examples/erc20) and I made several improvements to it.

- Remove the limit to the total tokens, as well as the initial tokens for the caller.
- Add the method `mint`
- Add the method `burn`
- Add an owner for the contract.
